What Is CmdUtils?
-----------------

CmdUtils has some helpers for writing command-line programs.  The
general style of output and API is the same as used in `virtualenv
<http://virtualenv.openplans.org>`_ and `pip
<http://pip.openplans.org>`_ (though these packages don't require
CmdUtils because they are written to have zero dependencies).

The primary feature is a logging object (:mod:`cmdutils.log`), and
some small routines to set up logging (:mod:`cmdutils` has optparse
code, and :mod:`cmdutils.arg` has argparse code).

``paster create``
-----------------

You can do ``paster create -t cmdutils`` to set up a new project (this
will use optparse, you'll have to hand-write your argparse setup).
